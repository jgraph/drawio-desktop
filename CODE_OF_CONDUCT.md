# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct:

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers aim to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment, including focusing on individual developers when a topic should be broadly addressed.
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
* Not respecting other people's time
* Being impatient or rude
* Pressing developers for priority fixes or ETAs
* Guilting the developers into focusing on your issue(s)
* Repeatedly showing an inappropriate level of entitlement, asking for issue status, or bumping issues.

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.
